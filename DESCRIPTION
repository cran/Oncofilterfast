Description: Aids in the analysis of genes influencing cancer survival by including a principal function, calculator(), which calculates the P-value for each provided gene under the optimal cutoff in cancer survival studies. Grounded in methodologies from significant works, this package references Therneau's 'survival' package (Therneau, 2024; <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival>) and the survival analysis extensions by Therneau and Grambsch (2000, ISBN 0-387-98784-3). It also integrates the 'survminer' package by Kassambara et al. (2021; <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survminer>), enhancing survival curve visualizations with 'ggplot2'.
